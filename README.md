# SimPyEcologySim: A SimPy Simulation for Ecological Systems

## Overview
SimPyEcologySim is an open-source project that utilizes the SimPy simulation framework to model ecological systems, aimed at providing tools for simulating various ecological scenarios. It is a part one of the experiments conducted in the context of the Franco-Algerian coordination project named Hubert Curien (PHC) Tassili , demonstrating its commitment to fostering international collaboration in ecological research and conservation efforts.

## Features
- **Ecosystem Simulation**: Models interactions between different species and their environment.
- **Population Dynamics**: Tracks changes in species populations over time.
- **Environmental Impact**: Assesses the impact of environmental changes on ecosystems.

## Getting Started
To get started with SimPyEcologySim, ensure you have Python and SimPy installed on your system. Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory.

git clone https://github.com/SamiGandhi/SimPyEcologySim.git
cd simulation_using_simpy

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- SimPy

## Usage
To run a simulation, execute the simulation script from the command line. For example:
python SIMULATION.py

Replace `ecosystem_simulation.py` with the name of the script you wish to run.
